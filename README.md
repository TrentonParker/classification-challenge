# classification-challenge

**This is my repository for the Module 13 Challange, 'classification-challenge'. In this challenge, I was able to split the data into training and testing sets, scale the features, create two different models that use machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), and evaluate each model. Both models had very good accuracy scores, however the Random Forest model was a tad better.**
